// src/services/mockData.ts
// This file previously contained mock data.
// Data is now intended to be fetched from Supabase via src/services/api.ts.
// Helper functions like calculateRagCounts have been moved or adapted within api.ts or utils.ts.

// You can keep this file for very small, specific mocks if needed for isolated testing,
// or delete it if all data fetching is through Supabase.

export {}; // Ensures the file is treated as a module
